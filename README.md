## - About Me
---
My name is Felipe Coutinho and I'm a software developer, a programmer.

I'm currently a computer science student at Universidade Federal Fluminense [(IC/UFF)](http://www.ic.uff.br), but I started studying programming languages when I was 12 with just a Java book and my curiosity. Now, at 22, here I am developing my own projects.

Right now I'm working with web a lot, both backend and frontend, so most of my repostiories are about this topic. However, most of my interest at the moment is about low-level programming, blockchain/web3 development and sometimes some CTF's just for fun.

My main language is portuguese, but I also can speak english fluently and at my free time I'm learning korean. So if you have an interesting project an can speak any of these 3 languages feel free to message me.

## - What you will find here:

Some of my projects. It's not all here, but a part of them is. Most of the time they are just small ideas, things I'd like to try out or little projects that helped me automate something I was currently interested in. There are also some portfolio websites or job interview tests that I applied to.

## - What you won't find here:

Mostly what you won't find here are just a bunch of stuff you can already find elsewhere on Github, so don't bother looking for it here. 

- Projects that were just a copy/paste from a 30 min youtube tutorial or any other "super special learning week";
- Funny gifs, emojis, libs or anything like that just to make this page feel cute, funny or "tech".

This stuff isn't my style, so if you care about emojis in the middle of documentation, I'm sorry. You won't find it here.
