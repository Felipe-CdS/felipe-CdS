### About Me
My name is Felipe and I'm a software developer, a programmer.
I'm currently a computer science student at Universidade Federal Fluminense [(IC/UFF)](http://www.ic.uff.br), but I started studying programming languages when I was 12 with just a Java book and my curiosity. Now, at 22, here I am developing my own projects.
My main language is Portuguese but I also can speak english and korean, so feel free to message me if you have an interesting project in these languages.
