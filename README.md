## - About Me:
Hi, my name is Felipe Coutinho. I'm currently a computer science student at Universidade Federal Fluminense [(IC/UFF)](http://www.ic.uff.br). My job experiences are mostly related to web development, both backend and frontend, so almost all of my repositories are about this topic. However, most of my interest at the moment is about low-level programming.

Here you'll find some of my projects. They're not all here, but some of them are. Most of the time they are just small ideas, things I'd like to try out, or little projects that helped me automate something I was currently interested in. There are also some portfolio websites or job interview tests that I applied to. For the most part, these projects don't have any real documentation. Maybe someday I'll add it :)
