## - About Me:
My name is Felipe Coutinho and I'm a software developer, a programmer.

I'm currently a computer science student at Universidade Federal Fluminense [(IC/UFF)](http://www.ic.uff.br), but I started studying programming languages when I was 12 with just a Java book and my curiosity. Now, at 22, here I am developing my own projects.

Right now I'm working with web a lot, both backend and frontend, so most of my repostiories are about this topic. However, most of my interest at the moment is about low-level programming, blockchain/web3 development and sometimes some CTF's just for fun.

My main language is portuguese, but I also can speak english fluently and at my free time I'm learning korean. So if you have an interesting project an can speak any of these 3 languages feel free to message me.

## - My progamming languages:
- C;
- Javascript / Typescript; 
- Java;
- Python;
- Solidity;

## - What you will find here:
Some of my projects. They're not all here, but some of them are. Most of the time they are just small ideas, things I'd like to try out or little projects that helped me automate something I was currently interested in. There are also some portfolio websites or job interview tests that I applied to.

## - My next steps:
Right now, my main programming goal is my blockchain analysis tool. That's what I'm working at the moment for real.

Some of the secondary goals are perhaps to start writing about my projects in an elegant way in a blog or real documentation. That's why most of them still don't have a proper description. I also want to write about low-level programming and this will be good, wait for it :)
